# Overview

In this workshop you will learn how to make standard regulatory tables and table
shells for clinical research using the {gtreg} package in R. This includes: 
adverse event tables, summary tables with multi-line statistics for continuous variables,
and raw data listings tables with grouped data. Table elements like headers, 
footers, or captions are customizable using {gtreg} column selectors, and the 
{gt} package can be used to implement final styling tweaks on your table. Lastly, 
{gtreg} tables are easily output to various formats, including HTML, PDF, RTF, Word, and Excel.

## Learning objectives

Build and customize tables often required for clinical reporting.

## Is this course for me?

If your answer to any of the following questions is "yes", then this is the right workshop for you.

-   Do you make adverse event tables or descriptive statistics tables in R? Or table shells for either?

-   Do you want your workflow to be reproducible?

-   Are you often frustrated with the immense amount of code required to create great-looking tables in R?

The workshop is designed for those with some experience in R. 
It will be assumed that participants can perform basic data manipulation.
Experience with the {tidyverse} and the `%>%` operator is a plus, but not required.

## Prework

Before attending the workshop please have the following installed and configured on your machine.

-   Recent version of **R** 

-   Recent version of **RStudio**

-   Most recent release of the [**gtreg**](https://shannonpileggi.github.io/gtreg/) and other packages used in workshop.

    ```r
    instll_pkgs <- c("gtreg", "gtsummary", "tidyverse", "labelled", "usethis")
    install.packages(instll_pkgs)
    ```
-   Ensure you can knit R markdown documents
    - Open RStudio and create a new Rmarkdown document
    - Save the document and check you are able to knit it.
