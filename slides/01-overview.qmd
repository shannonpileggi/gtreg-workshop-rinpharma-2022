# About adverse events

## Adverse events

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df_adverse_events |> 
  select(patient_id:drug_attribution) |> 
  slice(1:5) |> 
  gt::gt()
```

-   An adverse event (AE) is a medical issue that occurs during the course of treatment or observation.

-   AEs are classified according to a [hierarchy](https://www.meddra.org/how-to-use/basics/hierarchy), and we typically report lower level terms within a system organ class.

-   AEs also record severity / grade and likelihood of attribution to treatment.

## Summary table challenges

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df_adverse_events |> 
  select(patient_id:drug_attribution) |> 
  slice(1:5) |> 
  gt::gt()
```

-   Subjects experience multiple adverse events.

-   Not all enrolled subjects experience an adverse event.

-   The percent of subjects experiencing specific AEs is of interest; typically AEs are counted by maximum grade per event per subject.

-   Multiple AE tables are often required (treatment emergent AEs, AEs on specific treatment cycles, serious AEs, etc.).

## Counting by maximum grade

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df_adverse_events |> 
  select(patient_id, system_organ_class, adverse_event, grade) |> 
  slice(1:5) |>
  gt::gt() 
```

## Counting by maximum grade {transition="fade" visibility="uncounted"}

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df_adverse_events |> 
  select(patient_id, system_organ_class, adverse_event, grade) |> 
  mutate(ae_label = case_when(
    adverse_event == "Anaemia" ~ "Term 1",
    adverse_event == "Increased tendency to bruise" ~ "Term 2",
    adverse_event == "Thrombocytopenia" ~ "Term 3"
  )) |> 
  slice(1:5) |>
  tbl_listing(group_by = ae_label) |> 
  bold_labels()
```

## Counting by maximum grade {transition="fade" visibility="uncounted"}

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df_adverse_events |> 
  select(patient_id, system_organ_class, adverse_event, grade) |> 
  mutate(ae_label = case_when(
    adverse_event == "Anaemia" ~ "Term 1",
    adverse_event == "Increased tendency to bruise" ~ "Term 2",
    adverse_event == "Thrombocytopenia" ~ "Term 3"
  )) |> 
  slice(1:5) |>
  tbl_listing(group_by = ae_label) |> 
  bold_labels() |> 
  as_gt() |> 
  gt::tab_style(
    style = list(
      cell_fill(color = "#FFFBC8")
      ),
    locations = cells_body(rows = c(2, 4, 8))
  )
```

Similar logic applies when counting by severity (e.g. mild, moderate, severe) - if stored as a factor, the highest factor level is retained (severe).
